                <h2 id="1-backend-technology">1. Backend Technology</h2>
<p>Backend technology refers to the technologies used to build websites, applications, and other software. It is responsible for handling server-side logic and data storage to support the functionality of the front-end user interface. In simple terms, the front end is like the visible part of an iceberg above the water surface, providing users with a visual interactive interface. At the same time, the backend is the submerged body of the iceberg, providing robust support and data processing capabilities to the front end.</p>
<h2 id="2-evolution-of-backend-technology">2. Evolution of Backend Technology</h2>
<p>The development of backend technology can be traced back to the rise of the internet, closely intertwined with the complexity of websites and applications. Here are some significant stages in the evolution of backend technology:</p>
<h3 id="21-early-stages-1990s-simple-server-side-processing">2.1 Early Stages (1990s): Simple Server-Side Processing</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Internet, websites and applications were relatively simple. Backend logic was typically handled by scripting languages (such as Perl, and CGI scripts) or basic server-side programs (like the Apache server). These technologies were mainly used for handling basic HTTP requests and responses.</p>
<h3 id="22-introduction-of-dynamic-web-pages-and-databases-1995-2005">2.2 Introduction of Dynamic Web Pages and Databases (1995-2005)</h3>
<p>As websites and applications became more complex, the concept of dynamic web pages emerged. Server-side technologies started integrating with databases, allowing websites to dynamically generate content. Representative technologies of this stage include PHP, ASP, JSP, which, when combined with databases, enabled users to interact with more dynamic and personalized content.</p>
<h3 id="23-rise-of-server-side-frameworks-2005-2015">2.3 Rise of Server-Side Frameworks (2005-2015)</h3>
<p>With the increasing demand for complexity and maintainability, server-side frameworks started gaining popularity. These frameworks provided a structured way to organize code and introduced design patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC). Django (using Python), Ruby on Rails (using Ruby), and Express.js (using JavaScript) became popular choices.</p>
<h3 id="24-microservices-architecture-and-cloud-computing-2015-present">2.4 Microservices Architecture and Cloud Computing (2015-Present)</h3>
<p>Entering the 21st century, with the widespread adoption of cloud computing, microservices architecture gradually became the mainstream in backend development. Microservices architecture involves breaking down applications into small, independent services, each with its database. This makes applications easier to scale, maintain, and deploy. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes have facilitated the deployment and management of microservices.</p>
<h3 id="25-api-era-2010-present">2.5 API Era (2010-Present)</h3>
<p>APIs, as the core of backend technology, have become the standard for communication and data exchange between software components. Standards like RESTful API and GraphQL promote cross-platform and cross-language collaboration, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of software systems. APIs not only support multi-platform application development but are also closely related to microservices architecture and asynchronous communication, emphasizing the importance of security and permission management. In this era of APIs, they are not only the core of backend technology but also a key driving force for the entire software industry&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>The emergence of APIs has not only clarified the interaction rules between software components but also driven the standardization of designs like RESTful API and GraphQL. This loosely coupled design supports multi-platform application development, enabling backend services to adapt flexibly to various front-end applications. At the same time, API support has also propelled the development of microservices architecture, implementing independently running services through asynchronous communication. In the API-driven era, security and permission management have become crucial considerations.</p>
<h3 id="26-modern-backend-languages-2015-present">2.6 Modern Backend Languages (2015-Present)</h3>
<p>Modern backend languages like Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), Go, and Rust have become popular choices for backend development due to their efficient performance and modern syntax. The asynchronous and concurrent processing features of these languages make handling a large number of requests more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="27-serverless-computing-2015-present">2.7 Serverless Computing (2015-Present)</h3>
<p>Serverless computing abstracts the management of computing resources, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about underlying infrastructure. Services like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions support serverless architecture, further simplifying the backend development process.</p>
<h3 id="28-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-2015-present">2.8 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (2015-Present)</h3>
<p>With artificial intelligence and machine learning development, backend technology has started integrating these advanced technologies. Through APIs, developers can easily integrate machine learning models, natural language processing, and image recognition functionalities.</p>
<p>In this evolving journey, backend technology has progressed from simple server-side processing to a diverse and extensive ecosystem, continuously meeting the evolving demands of internet applications.</p>
