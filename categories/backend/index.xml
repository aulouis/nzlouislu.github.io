      <description>1. Evolution and Features of Java 1.1 Historical Overview The history of Java dates back to the early 1990s when it was introduced by Sun Microsystems.

In simple terms, the front end is like the visible part of an iceberg above the water surface, providing users with a visual interactive interface. At the same time, the backend is the submerged body of the iceberg, providing robust support and data processing capabilities to the front end.</description>
