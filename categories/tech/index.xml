      <description>Abstract The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has left a profound mark on the software development industry. AI code generation tools are emerging, automatically generating code to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, whether AI will completely replace human developers is still a controversial topic.&#xA;Should developers be worried about being replaced by AI?**&#xA;This question has been the focus of discussion for some time. Some people believe that AI will eventually achieve full automation of software development, putting developers at risk of unemployment.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.9 introduced the Admission Webhook extension mechanism, allowing developers to extend the functionality of the Kubernetes API Server flexibly. This extension occurs during the creation of resources, where the resources can be validated or modified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using a webhook is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require modification and recompilation of the API Server&amp;rsquo;s source code to extend its functionality. The inserted logic is implemented as an independent web process, passed as parameters to Kubernetes, and called back by Kubernetes during its own logic processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Istio 0.7 version utilized the Kubernetes webhook to achieve automatic sidecar injection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
