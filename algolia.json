In 1996, Java 1.0 was officially released, introducing cross-platform capabilities and object-oriented programming features, providing developers with a new experience. The object-oriented paradigm endowed Java code with higher maintainability and scalability, while the cross-platform nature, facilitated by the introduction of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), successfully realized the \u0026ldquo;write once, run anywhere\u0026rdquo; concept.","tags":["Java","Spring","Programming Languages","Software Development","Java Ecosystem","Spring Framework","Technology Trends","Python"],"title":"Java and Spring: In-Depth Analysis and Comprehensive Understanding","type":"post","url":"/2024/03/10/java-and-spring-in-depth-understanding/","weight":0,"wordcount":2414},{"author":null,"categories":["Frontend"],"content":"This article delves into the origins, history, and future trends of the three core technologies in frontend development: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
