AI code generation tools are emerging, automatically generating code to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, whether AI will completely replace human developers is still a controversial topic.\nShould developers be worried about being replaced by AI?**\nThis question has been the focus of discussion for some time. Some people believe that AI will eventually achieve full automation of software development, putting developers at risk of unemployment.","tags":["ai","Developer","Replace Human"],"title":"Will AI Completely Replace Human Developers?","type":"post","url":"/2024/05/24/will-ai-replace-human-developers/","weight":0,"wordcount":1190},{"author":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"Kubernetes 1.9 introduced the Admission Webhook extension mechanism.
